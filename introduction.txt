In the provided code, the ESN (Echo State Network) module and the Reservoir component communicate and interact primarily
 through the forward method of the ESN class, which utilizes the Reservoir for processing input sequences.
 Here’s a detailed breakdown of their interaction:

Initialization:
When an ESN object is instantiated, it also creates an instance of the Reservoir class.
This instantiation involves passing several parameters such as the activation mode (determined by the nonlinearity type
like 'tanh', 'relu', or 'id'), the input size, hidden size, number of layers, and others.
These parameters configure the reservoir’s behavior and are crucial for setting up the dynamics of the echo state network.

Forward Pass:
1. During the forward pass of the ESN module:
  (1)The input tensor and optional initial hidden state h_0 are passed to the reservoir.
     The Reservoir processes these inputs based on its configuration (like recurrent dynamics and state updates)
     and produces an output sequence and a new hidden state.
  (2)This output from the Reservoir is then potentially processed further within the ESN
     (e.g., handling washout periods, combining with inputs if w_io is true, and so on) before being fed into the
     readout layer.

Parameter Management:
The ESN module directly manages some parameters that influence the behavior of the Reservoir.
For instance, parameters like leaking_rate, spectral_radius, density, and w_ih_scale are used to initialize
the Reservoir and can dynamically affect how the reservoir processes information.

Readout Layer:
The output from the Reservoir (after any necessary processing steps such as washing out certain timesteps or
concatenating inputs) is eventually passed to a readout layer within the ESN.
This layer can be trained using various methods (like SVD or gradient descent) depending on the configuration.
The interaction at this stage is critical for adapting the network’s output to the specific task, such as
classification or regression.

Training and Parameter Updates:
While the internal weights of the Reservoir are typically fixed post-initialization (reflecting the "echo state"
property), the ESN manages the training of the output weights (readout layer) based on the reservoir’s outputs.
Training methods can include direct computational approaches (like Cholesky decomposition) or iterative updates
(gradient descent). The communication between the ESN and Reservoir is tightly integrated,
with the Reservoir handling the dynamic and memory aspects of the input processing,
and the ESN focusing on output generation and adaptation through its readout mechanism.
This design allows the ESN to leverage the reservoir's rich dynamics effectively while maintaining control over
output formation and learning.
